# Solution Overview
For more information about this solution, see [Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - PaaS Web Application Hosting for UK OFFICIAL Workloads](https://aka.ms/ukofficial-paaswa).

For deployment this blueprint uses linked Azure Resource Manager templates. There are a series of individual templates for each component that can be used to deploy each component individually; each of these templates have their own series of parameters and defaults. In the root folder, azuredeploy.json exposes a subset of parameters which have been derived to enable a simple deployment.  More advanced configurations can be achieved via customising the templates.

# Deploy the Solution

These templates will deploy a web application hosting architecture using Azure platform as a service components. Progress can be monitored from the Resource Group blade and Deployment output blade in the Azure Portal.

There are two methods that users may use to deploy this solution. The first method uses a Bash script, whereas the second method utilises Azure Portal to deploy the solution. These two methods are detailed in the sections below.

 As a pre-requisite to deployment, users should ensure that they have:

- An Azure Subscription
- Contributor or Owner rights to the Subscription

> If you would like to configure an Azure Active Directory Group as part of the scripted deployment you will need to have suitable permissions within your Azure Active Directory.

Other Azure architectural best practices and guidance can be found in [Azure Reference Architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/guidance/guidance-architecture). Supporting Microsoft Visio templates are available from the [Microsoft download center](http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/5/6/1569703C-0A82-4A9C-8334-F13D0DF2F472/RAs.vsdx) with the corresponding ARM templates found at [Azure Reference Architectures ARM Templates](https://github.com/mspnp/reference-architectures).

## Method 1: Azure CLI 2 (Express version)
To deploy this solution through the Azure CLI, you will need the latest version of the [Azure CLI 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) to use the BASH script that deploys the solution. Alternatively you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/). To deploy the reference architecture, follow these steps:
1. If you have access to multiple subscriptions use the command ```az account set --subscription <the subscription id you wish to use>``` to ensure you are targetting the correct subscription
2. Download the BASH script pre_reqs.sh, for example with the command ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/uk-official-paas-webapp/master/scripts/pre_reqs.sh```
3. Execute the script by using the command ```bash pre_reqs.sh```
4. If you do not know the short name of the region you wish to deploy to enter ```Y``` else enter ```N```
5. Enter the short name of the region you wish to deploy to e.g. ```northeurope```

> If the parameters files are not updated, the default values will be used which may not be compatible with your on-premises environment.

### Method 1a: Azure CLI 2 (Configuring the deployment via script arguments)
The ```pre_reqs.sh``` script supports a number of command line arguments that allow you to customise the deployment.  These are:

1. Region - should be a valid shortname for a region
2. Base Resource Name (used for uniqueness) - should be less than 15 chars and all lower case
3. Base Resource Group Name
4. SQL Admin configuration - valid options are ```Group```, ```User```, ```None```
5. Log Analytics SKU - valid options are ```Free``` or ```pergb2018```

>As the arguments are positional rather than named, you need to add them in the correct order.  If you specify arguments, you don't have to specify all of them. For example, you could provide just the first argument, or arguments 1,2 & 3. You cannot supply them out of order.

```bash pre_reqs.sh northeurope paasbp rg-ne-paas-blueprint```

## Method 2: Azure Portal Deployment Process

A deployment for this reference architecture is available on
[GitHub](https://aka.ms/ukofficial-paaswa-repo). The templates can be cloned or downloaded if customisation of parameters is requried.  To deploy the architecture, follow the steps below.

<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fuk-official-paas-webapp%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.png"/>
</a>

1. Click on the **Deploy to Azure** button to begin the first stage of the deployment. The link takes you to the Azure Portal.
2. Select **Create New** and enter a value such as `rg-uks-paas-blueprint` in the **Resource group** textbox.
3. Select a region such as `UKSouth` or `UKWest`, from the **Location** drop down box. **All Resource Groups required for this architecture should be in the same Azure region (e.g., `UKSouth` or `UKWest`).**
4. Review the available parameters and enter the appropriate values for your deployment - note that you will need to replace the function based defaults such as ```[uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)]```
5. Unlike the bash script in Method 1 the portal method will not create the additional resource groups, you can enter the resource group name from step 2 in **App Service Resource Group**, **Key Vault Resource Group**, **Storage Resource Group** and **Azure SQL Resource Group** - if you would like to deploy these resources to different resource groups you must create them seperately first.
6. Review the terms and conditions, then click the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox.
7. Click on the **Purchase** button.
8. Check the Azure Portal notifications for a message stating that this stage of deployment is complete, and proceed to the next deployment stage if completed.
9. If for some reason your deployment fails, it is advisable to delete the resource group in its entirety to avoid incurring cost and orphan resources, fix the issue, and redeploy the resource groups and template.
